Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality
figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms.  Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython_
shells, the Jupyter_ notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user
interface toolkits.

Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible.  You
can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts,
scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.  For examples, see the
:doc:`sample plots <tutorials/introductory/sample_plots>` and :doc:`thumbnail
gallery <gallery/index>`.

For simple plotting the `pyplot` module provides a MATLAB-like interface,
particularly when combined with IPython.  For the power user, you have full
control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc, via an object
oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.

Installation
------------

Visit the :doc:`Matplotlib installation instructions <users/installing>`.

Documentation
-------------

This is the documentation for Matplotlib version |version|.

To get started, read the :doc:`User's Guide <users/index>`.

Matplotlib is a welcoming, inclusive project, and we try to follow the `Python
Software Foundation Code of Conduct <coc_>`_ in everything we do.

Check the :doc:`FAQ <faq/index>` and the :doc:`API <api/index>` docs.

For help, join the `gitter channel`_ and the matplotlib-users_,
matplotlib-devel_, and matplotlib-announce_ mailing lists, or check out the
Matplotlib tag on stackoverflow_.  The `search <search.html>`_ tool searches
all of the documentation, including full text search of over 350 complete
examples which exercise almost every corner of Matplotlib.

You can file bugs, patches and feature requests on the `issue tracker`_, but it
is a good idea to ping us on the mailing list too.

To keep up to date with what's going on in Matplotlib, see the :doc:`what's

Toolkits
========

Matplotlib ships with several add-on :doc:`toolkits <mpl_toolkits/index>`,
including 3d plotting with `mplot3d`, axes helpers in `axes_grid1` and axis
helpers in `axisartist`.

Third party packages
====================

A large number of :doc:`third party packages <thirdpartypackages/index>`
extend and build on Matplotlib functionality, including several higher-level
plotting interfaces (seaborn_, holoviews_, ggplot_, ...), and two projection
and mapping toolkits (basemap_ and cartopy_).
